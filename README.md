# Data-Reduction-Notes
## Notes of the data reduction of different X-ray missions
There are many X-ray missions (NuSTAR, Suzaku, XMM-Newton...) that provide valuable data with which we have achieved huge progress in the understanding of the universe in the past decades. Usually, the raw data from each mission is in no good quality for quantitative analysis. People would have to reprocess the data according to specific purpose. This is what the "data reduction" in the title means.
